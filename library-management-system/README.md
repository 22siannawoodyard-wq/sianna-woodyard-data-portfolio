#  Library Management System – Microsoft Access Database  

##  Project Overview  
This project is a fully functional **Library Management System** built using **Microsoft Access** to manage book inventory, patrons, transactions, and reporting. It was designed to simulate how real libraries track checkouts, returns, member activity, and overdue items.

The system supports **data entry, automation, reporting, and relational integrity**, making it a strong example of applied database design for business and administrative environments.
